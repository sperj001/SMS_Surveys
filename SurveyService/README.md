## Description

The Survey Service is part of a larger service, the Staging Management Service (SMS). The Survey Service API allows a Revature staging manager to quickly generate a survey with custom questions and send the survey to a group of associates. Users who receive the survey are able to click a link and take the survey. The survey creator can then view the responses and is able to view charts and graphs of the data and gain insight into the preferences of the group.

There are different fields types that the survey creator can use for their inputs, including text, numbers, and dates. The survey questions and answers are customizable. There are different options for viewing the data, such as in pie charts. The goal of the data viewing is to allow the survey creator to gain insight into the preferences of the target group.

## Technologies Used
